# NLP-Powered-PG-Rent-Predictor-from-Descriptions
A machine learning project that uses NLP to predict PG (Paying Guest) rent from property descriptions. Built with scikit-learn, pandas, and text preprocessing techniques.

🏠 NLP-Powered PG Rent Predictor from Descriptions

This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning to predict the monthly rent of PG (Paying Guest) accommodations based on their textual descriptions. Using TF-IDF for feature extraction and regression models like Linear Regression and Random Forest, this tool estimates rent accurately from plain text inputs.
